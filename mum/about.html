		 	My name is Caroline Attfield and I have been a Blackheath resident for 20 years. I have had a 30 year career in the financial sector, the first 15 in senior executive positions and for the last 15 years have run my own business offering sales management and risk management advice to the financial sector. I am a guest speaker at UCL and am currently mentoring 2 technology start up companies. I have been married to Jonathan for 27 years and have two children at University.<br><br>
		 	My Conservatism stems from my passionate belief in equality of opportunity, supporting aspiration and free trade. I am a grammar school pupil and owed the achievement of my place at Oxford to read PPE in the 70s to the support of my family and the availability of an academically orientated secondary education.

		  	II witnessed at first hand how the economic reforms of the Thatcher years regenerated the ailing economy of the 3 day week. I am standing in this election to help fight the threat of a return to those high tax, red tape tied, over controlled days of a government with an over developed sense of entitlement and an under developed sense of responsibility. In my view Theresa May is securing Margaret Thatchers legacy. She sees what needs to be done and she has proved that she will deliver.

		 	I am a European. My grandmother was a shop girl near the front in the First World War when she met and married her Tommy. I have grown up with an extensive family of cousins in France and I speak fluent French. This does not mean that I like what the EU has become. It represents so much of the socialist leaning, controlling, interfering form of government that I grew up hating. We had a brave effort to start a process of reform in 2015 and found that it is a juggernaut that cannot turn. It is an Institution that is primarily run in the interests of its most powerful members and this is becoming clearer every day as they try to interfere in our general election. The EU will not change and I look forward to a time in which we can write our own laws and decide our own financial priorities.<br><br>

		 	I have loved living in Blackheath. I walk my retired Greyhound (pictured) acoss the Heath and into Greenwich park every day. I chaired the PTA at my daughter's school for 4 years and have been on the executive of East Lewisham Conservatives for most of the last 10 years.
