		<p>When I ran to be an MEP in 2014, I was full of hope and reforming zeal. Our prime minister has promised to lead reform and change in Europe and boy did it need it. I found a bloated and inefficient organisation supporting large numbers of people with non-jobs, thousands of lobbyists pouring money into parties to buy influence in a non transparent way and don't get me started on the cost and waste of time of maintaining duplicate buildings in Strasbourg that are only occupied for a handful of days a year.</p>
 
		This is an organisation which:

		<ul>
			<li>Cannot produce a set of auditted accounts</li>
			<li>Spends money on itself at an eye watering speed</li>
			<li>Pays the Duke of Westminster- the richest Englishman in the country &pound;637,709 in farm subsidies just because he owns so much land</li>
			<li>Pays millions to Russian Oligarchs and Oil rich sheiks for the same reasons Click <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17JXyhterJZ2UI5Z7YYmON6nKrtTLIS3rPCPT4x-CkCk/edit#gid=1315968968'><b>here</b></a> to see how many rich and famous foreigners receive these payments</li>
			<li>Tells me that I cannot put a ladder up against my house to clear my gutters under the EU health and safety directive</li>
			<li>Tells us that if we want to trade with South Africa we have to abide by the 2,100 pages of a trade agreement whose main purpose is to protect the European wine trade from South African Chardonnay.</li>
			<li>Puts a trade agreement with the US beyond delivery - the TTIP will never be signed there are too many vested interests amongst the 27</li>
		</ul>

		<p>During the Referendum campaign no one on either side could find a good word to say about the EU as an Organisation.</p>

		<p>I am excited and optimistic about the opportunites of a post Brexit world and although there may be bumps on the road I look forward to living in a country where our parliament controls our laws, our money and our borders.</p>
