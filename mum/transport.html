		<p>I have commuted from Stations within the area for 30 years. Those years have seen some major innovations and some fantastic engineering delivery not least amongst which are the Jubilee Line extension and the fantastic DLR covering Woolwich.</p>
 
		<p>Compared to when I started commuting, trains are faster, more reliable, cleaner and safer. The Buses have also improved. Dot matrix boards on both make transport choices clearer.</p>
 
		<p>The fact remains however that the infrastructure has simply not grown enough capacity for the explosion of high rise buildings throughout the constituency. I have heard of strategies that have transport hubs envisioned for Lewisham, Greenwich and Woolwich Aresenal but these are undermined by trains that go fast through these stations not allowing people to change.</p>

		<p>Pedestrian access at North Greenwich is shameful for the peninsula and I would back Greenwich Conservative councillors&rsquo; attempts to put Boris Bikes at key Greenwich locations.</p>
 
		<p>Consultations on changes seem determined to be under advertised and always aimed at reducing choice rather than increasing it. If elected I would campaign strenuously for a more intelligent, comprehensive transport system and ensure that it is kept in line in capacity terms with the forecast continued growth of housing.</p>
